Hi, my name is Mark. I am a full-stack web developer who's passionate about user experience. I believe in creating scalable systems, and therefore I focus on writing clean, clear, maintainable code for websites and web applications. I write, work and teach about web design and development.

##What Does Full-Stack Mean?

This means I have experience and comfort with both back-end and front-end systems. I work on regular basis with server-side languages such as PHP and ColdFusion, as well as many client-side technologies such as JavaScript, HTML and CSS.
