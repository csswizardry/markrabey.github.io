Hi, my name is Mark. I am a [full-stack](/blog/2014/08/15/the-full-stack-web-developer) web developer who's passionate about user experience. I believe in creating scalable systems, and therefore I focus on writing clean, clear, maintainable code for websites and web applications. I write, work and teach about web design and development.
