                    <p class="post__excerpt">It’s something that plagues many businesses, both small and large. Often business owners get into a particular mind-set when it comes to design projects. They assume that that can, and should, handle everything in-house rather than pay someone else to do it. First of all, there is no good reason why anyone <em>should</em> do everything. However, more importantly, it’s ridiculous to think that you <em>can</em> do everything.

It was kind of an extension of an even earlier post, <em><a href="/blog/2014/04/21/recognizing-team-dysfunctions/">Recognizing Team Dysfunctions</a></em>. In that I mentioned a few methodologies we could possibly use instead of Scrum, which I still firmly believe won’t work for our currently team.

Making use of the Twitter API, I have a bot that searches for Tweets with either #CFML or #ColdFusion, then retweets the most recent one. Pretty simple, and maybe not even 100% practical, but it’s all I was looking to do. A reader asked me if it was possible to Quote Tweet rather than Retweet.
