The other day I wrote [a post](/blog/2014/10/22/html-basics) about the absolute *basics* for beginning to understand HTML, and the web development process in general. In this post we looked a bit at how HTML is structured, and the basic syntax for create a page. We left off with something that looked like <a href="/demos/basic-html-6.html" target="_blank">this</a>. The next step here is to start adding some styles.

## **IMPORTANT**
I should note that the way I am doing things here is *not* how I typically go about developing a site. Personally, I get an idea of what the site is going to look like before I write *any* code. This involves sketches along with notes describing functionality. The process I'm using here is *strictly* for gaining an understanding of *how* things work. I'll get into different workflows in the future. For now, we'll kind of be building as we design. Not something I recommend long-term, but for getting started, I think it's perfectly fine.

## CSS, Bootstrap, and YOU!

### What is CSS?
CSS stands for **C**ascading **S**tyle **S**heet. This is what is added to an HTML document to tell the browser how to style your content. They are *cascading* because these styles are applied by the browser basically one-at-a-time in a sort of trickle down.

### What is Bootstrap?

Bootstrap is a CSS [framework](/blog/2014/05/16/css-frameworks/) originally developed at Twitter for use on their sites. It is an open-source project, which means members of the web development community have full access to the source code, and are free to use, edit, and even contribute to the project.

As I discuss in [this post](/blog/2014/05/16/css-frameworks/), using a framework has it's pros and cons, but in this situation they are great.
