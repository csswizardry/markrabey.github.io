Over a few posts ([part 1](/blog/2014/04/15/building-a-ghost-theme-part-1/), [part 2](/blog/2014/04/15/building-a-ghost-theme-part-2-npm-grunt-less-uglify/), [part 3](/blog/2014/04/16/building-a-ghost-theme-part-3-basic-layouts/), [part 4](/blog/2014/04/27/building-a-ghost-theme-part-4-styling-layouts/)), I was documenting my process for building a Ghost theme. While overall I found the process both fun, and educational, the end result was, well, for lack of a better word, crap.

At least it's currently that way. There is a lot to do involving fonts, colours, indenting, code blocks, SEO, Twitter Cards, Open Graph Tags...the list goes on. These are all things that are common, and individually not overly difficult, but I was naive to think I could put a decent theme together so quickly.

I want to actually get to building myself several themes. Partly because I want my own for my site, but I'd like to build a portfolio of themes to show off what I am capable of. The downside to working solely for an established company, is that I don't *really* do a lot of user-facing design work. In my current role, I develop a lot of administration tools, and I work on features of existing websites, but nothing that I can really show off to potential freelance clients, or possible future employers (no, I'm not actively seeking work, but I always keep my options open).

I've decided that what I really should be doing, is designing basic HTML and CSS Templates, that I can show off, then modify those into Ghost themes. To me this seems like the easiest way to get a few done fairly quickly, then as I port them to Ghost, I can share them with the community. Sounds good to me! I might even use Bootstrap for a couple...that's allowed, right?
