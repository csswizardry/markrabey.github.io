This site was built for Legend Computing - a computer repair company based in Orillia, Ontario. It's actually an ongoing project, with updates happening over the next couple of months.

### Overview
The project was actually pretty simple. Basically, they needed a site up. Time to market was somewhat important in this case, as were some budget constraints. Legend Computers offers computer repair services, as well as training for popular applications like Outlook and Microsoft Word. However, the owner, David, admitted he knew nothing about web design. This was really nice as it gave me full creative control. Of course, even with "full control" the client always has the final say, but in our case he has been very open to receptive to the ideas I have, recognizing that I am the professional in the situation.

### Challenges
Every project presents at least *some* challenges. If it goes perfectly, without a hitch, you probably forgot something. In this case the challenges were minimal, but were different from other projects. Part of what David was looking for was lessons on how to build a website *himself*. While not unheard of the challenge became the time it takes to learn and build things. David was actually the inspiration behind my [HTML Basics](/blog/2014/11/07/writing-good-css) post. After working through this post, he obviously had a lot of questions, and was eager to learn more. However, after talking further, we also determined that he wanted a site up fairly quickly. What some people don't realize, is the learning how to design and build a web page is actually fairly challenging if you want to actually *learn* HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Once you pick it up, it can feel pretty easy, but that initial learning curve is quite significant. We eventually decided we were better off to have me build it, and use that code a tool to teach him what I did. His lack of experience with HTML and CSS, lead to some of the technical decisions, such as the use of Bootstrap.

### About The Stack
This site is currently pretty small, and offers zero dynamic content. As some point a contact form, and some other details may be added, but for now, a simple static page was all that was really needed.

#### The Front-End
As I mentioned above, the site built using Bootstrap. This was a decision I thought long and hard about. Personally, I prefer not to use this type of framework, I find it often imposes many design constraints, and can sometimes be 'bloated' for what is needed. However, in this case, it was actually perfect. Due to the time lines, and the budget, Bootstrap was a great way to rapidly build the layout for the site. While I am also working on a framework for my own use, Bootstrap won the battle simply for its documentation. With this in hand, David can play around with different styles, and get down the basics of HTML layouts before actually learning CSS. This combined with Font-Awesome, and a few jQuery plugins for the smooth scrolling, made for a pretty quick development process.

#### Back-end & Hosting
For the back-end, I'm using Jekyll to generate static pages that are hosted with GitHub Pages. With my particular development environment, I didn't need to use GitHub, as I am not using there auto-generation of pages. I decided to stick with GitHub for now, as it makes it easy to have version control. I think every project should have some sort of version control, but especially because I'll be working on teaching the David, it makes it really easy to collaborate and comment on things. I'll be writing a full post on my development environment shortly, as it will likely be my setup for a few upcoming projects.
