title: When to Outsource
---
It's something that plagues many businesses, both small and large. Often business owners get into a particular mind-set when it comes to outsourcing projects. They assume that that can and should handle everything in-house rather than pay someone else to do it. First of all, there is no good reason why anyone *should* do everything. However, more importantly, it's ridiculous to think that you *can* do **everything**.
