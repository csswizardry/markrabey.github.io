title: Semantic CSS
---
The other day I wrote a little about [Semantic HTML](http://markrabey.com/2014/05/14/semantic-html/). Personally, I've found HTML semantics pretty straight forward. Use the thing that makes most sense, and best describes the content inside the tags. This is pretty simple when there are clearly defined elements. Most programming languages have guides or heavily enforced rules for naming conventions, code structures, and things like that. But what about CSS? It doesn't *really* have anything like that. There are some good dos and don'ts, but there are also a lot of grey areas. What I'm trying to do, is figure out what makes good, readable, maintainable CSS.
