A URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is a subset of the URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) that gives details of where an identified resource is located, and how to get it.

##Ok...So what's a URL?
URLs are meant to be a human readable replacement for the IP addresses that computers use to communicate with a server. They also contain the file structure of a website. In addition, they can be used to send parameters to the server for use in processing.

URL's have changed a lot over the past few years. With the rapid growth of dynamic websites, they quickly became much less human readable.
